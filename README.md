Hello there...

## My persona

I'm Luis, 26 (also known as Luvo, sometimes)!

Currently, I'm working at RTI (Real-Time Innovations) as a Software Engineer since 2019.

Apart from my professional side, I enjoy working on some side projects in my spare time.
I also love to practice sports ‚öΩ and play videogames üéÆ. I'm in üíú with mechanical
keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è too.

## Programming

In technical terms, I'm comfortable working with:

- **Python** for automation applications
- **CMake** and **Conan** for creating build systems and managing dependencies
- **Jenkins** to perform CI/CD
- **Docker** to create build environments and also ease the CI process

I use **Git** daily in multiple platforms like GitHub, Gitlab, or Bitbucket. Also, use
**Jira** or **GitHub Projects** for project management.

I'm a long-time GNU/Linux user (and fan!) having it as my main work/development OS.

You can find me as [lulivi](t.me/lulivi) @ Telegram.
